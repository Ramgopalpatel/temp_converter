Temperature Converter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Overview:
In this project, we'll create a simple temperature converter application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The application will consist of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For creating the structure of the webpage.
CSS3: For styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For handling temperature conversions and interactivity.
Features to Implement:

Input fields for users to enter temperature values.
Dropdown menus for users to select the input and output temperature scales (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, Re.).
Convert button to trigger the temperature conversion.
Display area to show the converted temperature.
Clear button to reset input fields and results.
Error handling for invalid inputs.
Steps to Implement:

HTML Structure:

Create input fields for users to enter temperature values.
Add dropdown menus for selecting input and output temperature scales.
Include buttons for converting temperatures and clearing inputs/results.
Create a display area to show the converted temperature.
Styling with CSS:

Apply CSS styles to make the interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
Design input fields, buttons, and display areas to ensure clarity and ease of use.
Temperature Conversion Logic:

Write JavaScript functions to handle temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Implement conversion formulas based on selected input and output scales.
Handle edge cases and validate input values to prevent errors.
Event Handling:

Add event listeners to the convert and clear buttons to trigger the corresponding actions.
Listen for changes in the input fields and dropdown menus to update conversion results dynamically.
Display Results:

Update the display area with the converted temperature value when the convert button is clicked.
Clear the display area and input fields when the clear button is clicked.
Error Handling:

Validate input values to ensure they are numeric and within reasonable ranges.
Display error messages for invalid inputs to guide users in providing correct input.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you'll be able to create a simple temperature converter application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides hands-on experience in building interactive web applications and practicing front-end development skills.
